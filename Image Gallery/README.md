## Description
We have a bunch of cute dog photos that we want to show one at a time. So, using CSS and JavaScript together, how could we do that?

Key take aways here:
- We're using CSS with display: none and display: block. 
- We're adding and removing classes to conditionally show and hide content.
- Anytime someone clicks Next, we want to take away the active class from the picture, and then apply the active class to the next picture. 
- If we enable a button that's already enabled, it just stays enabled. That's why we can set the disabled flag to true every single time.
